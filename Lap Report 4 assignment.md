# Vim Control with Timing Tasks
## We are going to edit some code in java file to fix the failing test using vim in the terminal!

### Step 1
```Log into ieng6```
First open your terminal as we did in report 1 and log into your ieng6 account.<br>

###### Your should enter your password like before. I made a ssh keys for ieng6 account so that's why I can get logged in automatically :)

### Step 2
```Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account```
Make a fork of the lab7 : https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7 on your Github account.

Click the green button "code" and make a copy of HTTPS.

Next, go back to your terminal that you logged in and type the HTTPS (https://github.com/ucsd-cse110-sp23/lab7.git) after git clone command. So it will be like ```git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse110-sp23/lab7.git```

**Keys Pressed**
: ```mkdir LABREPORT4``` I made a new folder to clone the repository and ```<enter>```. I typed git clone in the next command statement and ```<Command-V>``` to paste the HTTPS link.
