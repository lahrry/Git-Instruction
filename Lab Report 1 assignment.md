# Hi! So today we are going to learn about *remote access* that you will learn in CS15l. You'll be following steps that I provide below to log-in to a specific account on ieng6 .

## 1st Step : Creating CSE15L Account 

Go into this link -> [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

The 11 letters inside a red circle is your additional account and you will be using this account name!
<br>Next step is to reset your password. **REMAIN IN THE PAGE THAT YOUR ARE IN!** 
<br>This time click the "*change your password*" link shown as below.

<br>Enter your username which is your 11 digit additional account name shown as below

<br> 
Your 1st step is **almost** done!
<br>Open your terminal if you are Mac(if you are using Window download Visual Studio Code). *I will tell you how to download VS Code later on* 
<br>Try ssh 11DIGIT OF ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT_NAME @ ieng6.ucsd.edu in your terminal. Then enter your new password.  
<br>*"you can't see the password when you are typing in. You are doing it right, so no worries :)"*
