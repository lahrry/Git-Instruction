Re: Solving issue with reversed() method in ArrayExamples.java debugging

Hi this is Bella Jeong who is cs15l tutor and thank you for reaching me out. 
I will be helping you out with this problem today! 
As I can see, I think you have a problem in "reversed()" method in ArrayExamples.java file. I don't see any problems in your ArrayTests.java file however, I think there could be an error in your ArrayExamples.java code, specifically in reversed() method. Can you please share your ArrayExamplese.java code?
